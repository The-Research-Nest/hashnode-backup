## The Research Nest is migrating to Hashnode

# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

We are a tech blog and needed something more than *medium*.

- More power ðŸ”‹

- More customization ðŸŽ†

- More features â›²

It was time to upgrade ðŸš€

We do love Medium but it just doesn't have the features we are looking for. Here is our original publication.

<h3 id="custom-h3">So, what next? ðŸ¤”</h3>

- We are not entirely moving away from it, having built a presence there.
- This will be a gradual migration where we publish more in-depth and code-focused articles and tutorials on Hashnode.
- We will continue to manage our Medium publication to cover tech news and general content that doesn't require markdown or any custom features.
- We will be cross-publishing and republishing some of our work across platforms in the few months ahead till we establish our presence on Hashnode.

Oh, yes, we are open to guest blog posts and contributors on Hashnode too, following the same terms and benefits we have set on Medium as published in <a id="custom-link" href="https://medium.com/the-research-nest/trn-guest-blogging-2817c4ca31d3">this blog</a>.

A more detailed article specific to Hashnode contributors will be published soon.

#StayTuned.
